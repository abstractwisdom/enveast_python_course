# Why should you be bothered to take this course?
* Python is a modern, interpreted, object-oriented, open-source language with a large community support. Python language is a robust integration platform for Environmental Sciences work, from data analysis to distributed computing, and graphical user interfaces to geographical information systems. Among its salient features, Python has a concise but natural syntax for both arrays and non-arrays, making programs exceedingly clear and easy to read.

* The Environmental Sciences community has begun to recognize the unique benefits of Python, and as a result its population of users is growing, while Python libraries are becoming the industry standard. Institutional support includes groups at the Met Office, the British Atmospheric Data Centre, Cefas, the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and EUMETSAT.

* Adopting Python as the main computing tool encourages better coding practices, efficient data analysis and open-access research, helping scientific community reduce the so-called reproducibility crisis.

* The course aims to encourage the academic world to move away from proprietary software such as MATLAB or IDL, which costs institutions significant amount of money.
